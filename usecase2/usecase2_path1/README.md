# MONITORING

## ‚û°Ô∏è Running the examples

üëâ Start up the observability stack (we use Prometheus and Grafana) and wait for it to start. 
You have to navigate to the monitoring folder first and then run docker compose.
```
docker compose up
```
* To access Prometheus go to http://localhost:9090/
* To access Grafana go to http://localhost:3000/

üëâ Go back to the main folder `3_java_spring_boot` and run the application (this will block your current terminal window).
```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run 
```

You should see log statements similar to these:

```

```

üëâ Go to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000/), go to dashboards, and click on the `Spring Boot Statistics` dashboard. You will see some metrics related to HTTP request. These come from the automated Spring Boot WebMvc instrumentation that uses the Micrometer API.

How to shutdown the example?

```
docker compose down
```
